*There may be a missing or skipping number for the file (HW), but this does not imply a missing file. It only indicates a class that has been cancelled due to a holiday.*

***Please note that solutions may not be 100% accurate. The codes have been passed and graded, and does make sense, however, it was graded based on the requirement of the course. Therefore, it is fair to say that the solutions, especially the codes, are accurate if applied in a real world situation.***

*For Lab assignments, I do not have the full set of solutions for each of the assignment, since this was my first semester and I was not aware that I could not have access to the course after the Canvas (student platform) once the semester finishes. Therefore, I have included what I have on my laptop - I do not have all the files as I was cleaning my laptop which I had no space to hold more files.*
