This repository consists of projects derived from the Data Science course (Data 8) of University California Berkeley. 
These projects are part of the MATH108 Foundations of Data Science at the City College of San Francisco in Fall 2024.
The course uses Jupyter notebook using Python, mainly the NumPy library.

*There may be a missing or skipping number for the file (HW), but this does not imply a missing file. It only indicates a class that has been cancelled due to a holiday.*

***Please note that solutions may not be 100% accurate. The codes have been passed and graded in the Jupyter notebook, and does make sense, however, it was graded based on the requirement of the course. Therefore, it is fair to say that the solutions, especially the codes, are accurate when applied in a real world situation.***

*For Lab assignments, I do not have the full set of solutions for each of the assignment, since this was my first semester and I was not aware that I could not have access to the course after the Canvas (student platform) once the semester finishes. Therefore, I have included what I have on my laptop - I do not have all the files as I was cleaning my laptop which I had no space to hold more files.*

Note: Labs were done during the class and due the day after, it is in .html and was only for graded for completion. Homeworks (HW) are the most important, as they were graded for accurateness.
